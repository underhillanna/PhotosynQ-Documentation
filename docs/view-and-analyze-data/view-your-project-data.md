# View Project Data

You can view the data collected for your Project at an time to follow the progress.

## Browser

1. Bring up your profile by selecting **Your Name** from the top menu bar.
2. Navigate to your Project by selecting it from the **Projects** or **Collaborations** Tab.
3. Select **View Data** from the menu on the left of the Project page.

!> **Note:** If you have collected more than 1000 measurements or you have a slow internet connection it might take a while to load all the data.

### Troubleshooting

If you use a mobile device to analyze the data, the memory might not be sufficient enough to display everything.

We strongly recommend to use a **Desktop Computer** to view and analyze your data!
