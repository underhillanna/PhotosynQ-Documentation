# Discover

Not only can you search your own Projects, but you can search through all Projects available on PhotosynQ. Select **Discover** from the Menu and bring up the search input field by tapping on the <i class="fa fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></i> search icon. After entering your query the search returns a list of matching Projects. Tap the project you are interested in to see more details.

## Join a Project

If you search for Projects and you find a Project you would like to participate in, you can join them from the app using the Join button. The Project will be automatically added to your list of My Projects and will also be available under Collaborations on your user profile at the website and in the mobile app.

!> **Note:** Some Projects cannot be joined, since they are only accessible to a small group of people. These Projects are indicated by a small lock icon in front of the Project title.
