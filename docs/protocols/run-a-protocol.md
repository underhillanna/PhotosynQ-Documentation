# Run a Protocol

All the Protocols you or the community developed on PhotosynQ can be used independent from Projects. When using the desktop application, those measurements can be saved to the notebook.

## Desktop Application

There are two ways to run a Protocol outside of a Project. Open the list of Protocols by selecting **Protocols** from the left menu bar or using the shortcut `Ctrl+3 / ⌘3`.

1. A **Single Click** on a Protocol from the list will bring up the information in the side bar. Select **Run** to start the Protocol.
2. A **Double Click** on a Protocol from the list will start it immediately.

?> **Tip:** You can use the protocols from others when you select **Explore** from the top menu.

### Protocol Editor

The Desktop Application also allows to edit Protocols. When using the Protocol Editor, the Protocol can be started by selecting **<i class="fa fa-play"></i> Run** from the menu.

## Mobile Application

The Mobile Application allows to run Protocols without Projects as **Quick Measurements**. These measurements cannot be saved.
