  "description": "`number_samples` sets the number of samples taken by the ADC (analog to digital converter) on the sample and hold circuit. The median value of these samples is then saved as a single detector value in \"data_raw\".  The ADC is used to measure the detectors (1 - 4).  This value is already set to the optimum value, and most signal noise comes from other source, but in certain cases increasing the value may yield improved signal.",
