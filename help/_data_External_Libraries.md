### External Libraries

PhotosynQ offers you **External Libraries** for [Python](python) and [R-Project](r-project). To get started, install the library for the language you are using. Then navigate to your Project page. Select **External Libraries** from the download options which brings up a dialog with code examples for **Python** and **R**. Simply copy the code into your script to generate a data-frame. Your email address and Project ID are already included, so you can execute the code right away.

#### Python

##### Installation

Make sure you have [Python](python) (2.7+ or 3.3+) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed. Use the following command in your terminal to install the Library.

```Bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Photosynq/PhotosynQ-Python.git --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```

After you installed the library, you can start accessing the data directly from PhotosynQ.

##### Accessing Project Data

To access the data from a Project you just need a [PhotosynQ Account](/account/Create_an_Account) and the **Project ID**. You can find the Project ID in the sidebar of the Project Page and in the list of Projects on your User page.

The following simple script can be used to generate a data-frame containing the project data.

```Python
import photosynq_py as ps

# use your photosynq account to login (you will be prompted for your password)
email = "john.doe@domain.com"
ps.login(email)

# retrieve a dataframe with data from the given project ID
projectId = 1556
df = ps.get_project_dataframe(projectId)

# logout
ps.logout();
```

When you run the script you will be prompted to enter your PhotosynQ password. It will not be saved and needs to be entered again, if you re-run the script. The variable `df` represents the data-frame, generated by the library using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).

##### The Data-Frame

The object returned is a dictionary of data-frames. You can select a frame by using the Protocol name. If multiple Protocols were used, multiple data-frames are available, one for each Protocol.

```Bash
Dictionary of n
  Dictionary['Protocol Name'] (DataFrame):
    'datum_id': int64
    'time':     int64
  ..
```

The dataset contains flagged data as well, so when you analyze your dataset you might want to filter out the flagged data points.

```Python
protocol = 'Protocol name'
dt_filtered = df[( df[protocol]['status'] == 'submitted')]
```

***Tip:*** Please find more information about functions in this library on [GitHub](https://github.com/Photosynq/PhotosynQ-Python)

#### R (R-Studio)

##### Installation

Make sure you have [R](r-project) installed. We recommend using it in combination with [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Then run the following two commands in the R-Console.

```R
## Makes the developer tools avaialble
library(devtools)

## Install the PhotosynQ package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("PhotosynQ/PhotosynQ-R")
```

Please find more options for installing the R package [here](https://github.com/Photosynq/PhotosynQ-R#installation).

##### Accessing a Project

To access the data from a Project you just need a [PhotosynQ Account](/account/Create_an_Account) and the **Project ID**. You can find the Project ID in the sidebar of the Project Page and in the list of Projects on your User page.

The following simple script can be used to generate a data-frame containing the project data and viewing the data from the data-frame.

```R
# retrieve a dataframe with data from the given project ID
ID <- 1556
df <- PhotosynQ::getProject("john.doe@domain.com",ID)

# View the Protocol Data
View(df$`Protocol Name`)
```

When you run the script you will be prompted to enter your PhotosynQ password. It will not be saved and needs to be entered again, if you re-run the script. The variable `df` represents the data-frame.

##### The Data-Frame

The object returned is a list of data-frames. You can select a frame by using the Protocol name. If multiple Protocols were used, multiple data-frames are available, one for each Protocol.

```Bash
List of n
 $ Protocol Name:'data.frame':
  ..$ datum_id      : num [1:n] 335742 335741 ...
  ..$ time          : Factor w/ n levels "2016-07-12 12:21:14",..: 175 ...
  ..
```

The dataset contains flagged data as well, so when you analyze your dataset you might want to filter out the flagged data points.

```R
# Library to make the filter function available
library(dplyr)

# Filter out flagged data
df_filtered <- filter(df$`Protocol Name`, status == "submitted")
```
