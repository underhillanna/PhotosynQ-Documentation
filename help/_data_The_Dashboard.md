### Use the Dashboard
The dashboard can show a number of **Panels** showing what is important to you. You can drag and rearrange panels as you like. Click on the big **+** to bring up the panel selection dialog, or add plots from the plot view.

***Tip:*** Next time you view the project data, your dashboard will be restored.

#### Plots
You can plot parameters against each other using the plot tool. 
1. In the menu bar above the plot select **Dashboard**
2. Enter a name or use the suggested and click on **OK** to add the plot to your dashboard.

***Tip:*** You can click on panels with plots to load the plot into your plot view.

#### Measurements

| Panel  | Function |
| ------ | -------- |
| **Parameter Average**  | Show average and distribution for the selected parameter |
| **Contributions** | Show user contributions in total and for the last 30 days |

***Tip:*** A click on a **Parameter Average Panel** will bring up the statistics summary for each **Series**.

#### Quality Control - Flagged Data

| Panel  | Function |
| ------ | -------- |
| **Instrument** | Flagged and un-flagged data points per instrument |
| **User**   | Flagged and un-flagged data points per user |

***Tip:*** These panels can help you identifying issues with a user, device or with the approach in general in which measurements are taken.
