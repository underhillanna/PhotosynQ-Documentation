#### Android - Connect a new Instrument (Bluetooth)

When connecting an Instrument for the first time, you have to pair it with your device. The pairing only needs to be done once, and only repeated, if the Instrument has been paired with a different device in between.

1. Go to the **My Projects** page within the app.
2. Select the Instrument icon on the top right of the page.
3. A list of available Bluetooth Instruments will appear.
4. Below the Instrument name will be its ID. This should match the MAC address on your Instrument (screen A, below)
    - If your Instrument does not appear, click on **SCAN DEVICES**
    - You may have to click **SCAN DEVICES** multiple times before your Instrument appears.
5. Select on the appropriate Instrument.
6. A pop-up will appear asking to pair the device by entering the Instrument PIN. **The PIN is 1234 and is the same for every MultispeQ.**
7. After pairing the MultispeQ, you will be taken back to the Device list. Select your MultispeQ from the list, if the screen B (below) appears your device is connected.

#### Android - Connecting an already paired Instrument (Bluetooth)

In case you already paired your Instrument with a device, you only have to select your Instrument from the list to connect it.

### Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble connecting to your Instrument, please go through this checklist first:

- Make sure your Instrument is fully charged (at least 6h, or over night).
- Make sure you have turned on the Instrument by pressing and holding the power button for 5 seconds. **The device will automatically shut off after 3 hours of inactivity**
- If you were using the Instrument with another mobile device, you will need to press and hold the power button for 5 seconds to disconnect it from the previous device and make it available to a new device.
- If you are using Windows 8 or lower, make sure you have the [serial driver](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) installed.
